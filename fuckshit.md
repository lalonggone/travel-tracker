# PULL REQUEST

## 🚀 Changes

- Added ... Total $ spent and the traveler's past, upcoming and pending trips. Added very little styling.. definitely need to dig into that more later. Looks like 💩 right now !
- Refactored ... I separated some functionality from the getAllData promise in scripts.js to make it easier to read. I also refactored some of the structure in that promise, again for better organization and clarity. The HTML is a little different since I'm passing data into the trip-type containers dynamically.

## 📝 Additional Notes

the aside is pictured above.. it is currently commented out in the code. I'm toying with the idea of making the new trip form with the aside or as a section that is centered / inline with the trip containers. 

I also want to make the trip cards into a grid but was struggling on it for too long.. come back later
